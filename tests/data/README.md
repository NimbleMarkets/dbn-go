# go-dbn test data

These test data files were taken from Databento's test corpus:

 * https://github.com/databento/dbn/tree/main/tests/data

Data file checksums are stored in [`checksums.txt`](./checksums.txt) and calculated with `shasum -a 256 <filename>`.

JSON test files were created using `dbn --json` and `dbn --json --metadata` commands.
